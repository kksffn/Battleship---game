Let's play the game BATTLESHIP.
It's the game for two players. Each player places his ships on the grid (10x10). The ships can't touch each other. You don't know where the opponent's ships are.
Your GOAL is to sink all of your opponent's ships.
You call out grid coordinates - this is your shot. Your opponent says "HIT" or "MISS" and he has to tell you, if the ship is sunk.
